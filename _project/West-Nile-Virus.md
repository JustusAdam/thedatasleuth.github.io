West Nile Virus (WNV) was first discovered in Uganda in 1937 and persists through the present day in many disparate parts of the world, spreading primarily through female mosquitoes and affecting several types of bird species, as well as other mammals like horses and humans.  Infected victims can either be asymptomatic (75% of cases) or display symptoms like fever, rash, vomiting (20% of cases), encephalitis/meningitis (1% of cases), and in rare instances death (1 out of 1500).[^1]  While the first case of WNV in the US was reported in Queens, NYC in 1999, Chicago has been particularly plagued by the disease since it was first reported in the Windy City in 2001.  As of 2017, Chicago has reported 90 cases of WNV, eight of which resulted in death.[^2]  

Since 2004, Chicago has had set up a surveillance system of mosquito traps designed to monitor which areas of the city were positive for WNV which remains in effect today.  Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.

In June 2015, the City of Chicago [released their data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus) to Kaggle in the form of a competition, asking competitors to analyze their datasets and predict which areas of the city would be more prone to WNV outbreaks, thereby allowing the City and Chicago Department of Public Health (CPHD) to allocate resources more efficiently.  The prize, $40,000.

While I was a little late to the competition, this dataset remains one of the more popular sets to analyze, given its depth, complexity, and uniquely inherent challenges.  Below, I identify the challenges that came up for me when analyzing this dataset as well as the techniques I used to resolve them.
